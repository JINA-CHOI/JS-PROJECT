                    <span>In Jeju Island, there was a Tamna Kingdom established by Yang, Go, Bu, and 
                        Samseongsin during the ancient period, and it was integrated into Korea during 
                        the Goryeo Dynasty. In terms of administrative district, Jeju Island belonged 
                        to Jeollanam-do, but was separated from Jeollanam-do in 1946 and promoted to 
                        Jeju Special Self-Governing Province in 2006 under the Special Act on the 
                        Establishment of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province and the Creation of an 
                        International Free City.</span>

                    <h4 class="content-title">Vision</h4>
                    <span>Most of Jeju Island is covered with dark brown volcanic ash, 
                        making it difficult to cultivate rice. Instead, special agriculture 
                        has been developed to cultivate tangerines and pineapples suitable for 
                        climates with an average annual temperature of 15Â°C or higher while mainly 
                        farming barley and potatoes. In addition, the fishing industry that catches 
                        hairtail, sea bream, conch, and abalone was developed by taking advantage of 
                        the fact that the slope is the sea. Today, although it has decreased a lot,
                         there were many haenyeo who dug up seafood. In addition, livestock farming was 
                         developed in the middle mountainous area to graze horses and cattle, and Jeju 
                         ponies have been a specialty of Jeju since ancient times.</span>

                        is one of Jeju's representative tourist destinations, and the Jusangjeolli, 
                        which overlooks the waves, and the Yongmeori Coast, a promenade on the sea, 
                        are considered natural scenery that can only be seen in Jeju. Seopji Course, 
                        known as the filming location of the drama, is steadily loved, and Hallabong, 
                        black pork, and silver hairtail are representative foods of Jeju.</span>
